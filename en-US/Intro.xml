The <ulink url="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOSpace/20150601/VOSpace.pdf">
"VOSpace, Version 2.1"</ulink> says: 
"A VOSpace web service is an access point for a distributed storage 
network. Through this access point, a client can:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
add or delete data objects
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
manipulate metadata for the data objects
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
obtain URIs through which the content of the data objects can be
accessed
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
VOSpace does not define how the data is stored or transferred, only the
control messages to gain access. Thus, the VOSpace interface can readily be
added to an existing storage system.
When we speak of “a VOSpace”, we mean the arrangement of data 
accessible through one particular VOSpace service."

The vospace-backend is a storage service management to 
integrate a VOSpace interface implementation with
a storage solution. This software module persists the
information linking a VOSpace Node Identifier with a
vospace backend stored file, so it is able to return URIs to 
access the content of the data objects. 
        </para>
        <para>
The storage solution can
be changed thanks to a plug-in architecture allowing to
plug-in at run time different storage solutions simply implementing 
an abstract java class.
	</para>
	<para>
The service requires an SQL Resource DataBase Management Service (RDBMS)  
as default built-in persistence layer.
        </para>
        <para>
vospace-backend provides a RESTful interface.
